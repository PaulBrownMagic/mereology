%  A is a part in the thing under
%  analysis
:- multifile(part/1).

%  B is a part of A is the

%! proper_extension(A, B) is det.

%  of A and the two parts aren't equal

%! part_overlaps(A, B) is det.
%  A and B overlap if there is some
%  part of which both A and B are parts.
part_overlaps(A, B) :-
	fail.

%! part_underlaps(A, B) is det.
%  A and B underlap if there is some

%! part_disjoint(A, B) is det.
%  A and B are disjoint if they don't
